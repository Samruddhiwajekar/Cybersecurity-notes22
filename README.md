## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are typically aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

### Key Goals of Cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality** – Keeping data private
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data isn't tampered with
- **Availability** – Making sure data and systems are accessible when needed (CIA Triad)

## 🎯 3 Core Domains of Cybersecurity

### 🔵 Blue Team (Defensive Security)
- Focuses on defense and protection of systems
- Monitors, detects, and responds to threats
- Uses tools like SIEM, firewalls, IDS/IPS
- Key tasks: Incident response, threat hunting, patch management

### 🔴 Red Team (Offensive Security)
- Emulates attackers to find vulnerabilities
- Performs penetration testing and ethical hacking
- Focuses on exploiting weak points before real attackers do
- Key tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite

### 🟣 Purple Team (Bridge Between Red & Blue)
- Integrates Red and Blue teams for better collaboration
- Enhances communication and knowledge sharing
- Ensures security gaps are found and patched effectively
- Focuses on continuous improvement of defenses
